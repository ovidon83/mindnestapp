# "See it in action" Redesign Plan

## Current Issues:
- Too text-heavy and long
- Complex nested structure
- Hard to scan quickly
- Lacks visual impact

## New Approach:
1. **Single Thought Card** - Prominent, beautiful card showing the captured thought
2. **4-Step Visual Flow** - Horizontal timeline with numbered steps (Analyze → Connect → Act → Insights)
3. **Social Posts Preview** - Compact grid showing ready-to-share posts
4. **Simplified Mind Report** - Key metrics only, less clutter

## Design Principles:
- Visual > Text
- Simple > Complex
- Scannable > Dense
- Wow factor through clean design and spacing
